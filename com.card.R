This is absolute madness from the referee who really should be making better calls than that. This has changed the landscape of the game!")

You can NOT do that on the pitch, he really needs to learn to control his anger. It's no wonder the referee is reaching for his pocket now. What was he thinking with that ${a}? Now ${y} has to play with one of their players on a ${z} card which will make this game a lot more difficult.")

It was one of the cleanest tackles I've ever seen, but the ref had an obscured view and decided to give the player a ${z} card for his troubles. It's no wonder that the whole ${y} team is pleading with the ref on this one, but once the card has been awarded there's no changing it. That blown call has to be one of the stories of the game! Let's just hope the team can cope with one of their stars now on a ${z}.")
